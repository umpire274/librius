//! Database initialization utilities for Librius.
//!
//! This module provides a small helper to initialize (or open) the SQLite
//! database used by the application. The `init_db` function ensures the
//! required `books` table exists and returns an active `rusqlite::Connection`.
//!
//! The schema is intentionally simple and stores basic metadata for each
//! models (title, author, year, isbn and a timestamp when the record was
//! added).
