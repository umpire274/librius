# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-10-18

### Added

- New command `add book`:
    - Fetches book information automatically from the Google Books API using ISBN.
    - Populates title, author, editor, year, language, genre, and summary automatically.
    - Fallback to interactive mode (planned) for books not found.
- Integrated dynamic i18n support for all CLI help messages (`add`, `book`, `isbn`).
- Added automatic language name resolution (e.g., `"it"` → `"Italian"`).
- New utility module `utils/lang.rs` for ISO 639-1 to language name conversion.
- Localized console messages for book lookup and insertion results.

### Changed

- Modularized command structure: added `add.rs` and `add_book.rs` under `src/commands/`.
- Improved error handling for Google Books API responses and JSON decoding.
- Replaced manual `impl Default` blocks with idiomatic `#[derive(Default)]`.

### Fixed

- Deserialization issues with Google Books API fields (`volumeInfo`, `publishedDate`, `pageCount`).
- Empty fields on insertion caused by incorrect field mapping.

### Example usage

```bash
$ librius add book --isbn 9788820382698
🔍 Ricerca del libro con ISBN: 9788820382698
📘 Libro trovato: “La lingua dell'antico Egitto” — Emanuele M. Ciampini (2018)
✅ Libro “La lingua dell'antico Egitto” aggiunto con successo.

---

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-16

### Added

- Introduced the `tabled` crate (`v0.20.0`) for tabular output.
- New `--short` flag for `librius list` showing only key columns (ID, Title, Author, Editor, Year).
- New utility `build_table()` in `utils/table.rs` to render tables with consistent style and alignment.
- CLI option `--delimiter` / `-d` for `import` command.  
  Allows specifying a custom CSV field separator (default: `,`).

### Changed

- Refactored `list` command to use `BookFull` and `BookShort` wrappers implementing `Tabled`.
- Standardized module structure across the project:
    - Each main directory (`commands`, `db`, `config`, `i18n`, `models`, `utils`) now includes a `mod.rs`.
    - Unified import/export logic in `lib.rs` for cleaner module access.
- Improved code readability, organization, and adherence to Rust idioms.

### Refactored

- Extracted duplicated import logic into reusable helper functions:
    - `utils::open_import_file()` now handles file opening with localized error reporting.
    - `utils::handle_import_result()` manages database insert results and counters.
- Unified behavior between `handle_import_csv()` and `handle_import_json()`.
- Simplified error handling and improved localization consistency across import operations.
- Reduced code duplication and improved maintainability throughout the import module.

### Fixed

- **CSV/JSON import deserialization error**:  
  The `id` field in the `Book` struct is now optional (`Option<i32>`),  
  preventing missing-field errors during import when the ID column is not present.

### Removed

- Legacy manual `println!` formatting for book listings.

---

## [0.2.5] - 2025-10-15

### Added

- **Backup command** (`librius backup`)
    - Creates plain `.sqlite` backups in the `backups/` directory
    - Optional `--compress` flag for compressed backups
        - `.zip` format on Windows
        - `.tar.gz` format on macOS and Linux
    - Localized help and messages via i18n (English and Italian)
    - Timestamp-based file naming for safe sequential backups
    - Fixed backup compression error on macOS/Linux (`paths in archives must be relative`).

- **Export command** (`librius export`)
    - Added support for exporting library data in multiple formats:
        - `--csv` (default): plain text export with semicolon delimiter
        - `--json`: structured JSON array output
        - `--xlsx`: formatted Excel file using umya-spreadsheet
    - Localized CLI help and status messages (English/Italian)
    - Automatic export directory and timestamped filenames
    - Uses `dirs` crate for cross-platform export path handling

- **Import command** (`librius import`)
    - Supports importing book data from external sources
    - Available formats:
        - `--csv` (default): semicolon-delimited CSV
        - `--json`: JSON array of objects
    - Unified parsing via `serde` and shared `BookRecord` struct
    - Duplicate detection through unique index on `isbn`
    - Uses `INSERT OR IGNORE` for idempotent imports (no duplication)
    - Verbose mode logs skipped records (e.g., “Skipped duplicate ISBN: …”)
    - Non-blocking import completion logging

### Database

- Added migration `PATCH_004_ISBN_INDEX`:
    - Creates unique index on `books.isbn` to prevent duplicates
    - Automatically applied during startup migrations

### Technical

- Added dependency: `csv = "1.3"` for CSV import with serde
- Unified SQL insert logic via `insert_book_record()` helper
- Improved transaction safety and i18n message consistency

---

## [0.2.4] - 2025-10-15

### Added

- Full internationalization (i18n) for CLI help, subcommands, and arguments.
- Embedded JSON language files (`en.json`, `it.json`) — no external dependencies required.
- Dynamic language selection via `--lang <code>` or the `language` key in `librius.conf` (YAML).

### Fixed

- Resolved duplicated `--help` and `--version` flag conflicts in Clap.
- Restored proper `--help` propagation for subcommands (`list`, `config`).
- Ensured fallback to English if an unknown language code is provided.

### Changed

- Pre-language bootstrap messages (e.g., “Load configuration...”) remain in English for clarity.
- Improved initialization order: configuration and DB migrations now run after language setup.

### Notes

- Default language remains English unless overridden by `--lang` or the `language` field in `librius.conf` (YAML).
- This version finalizes the transition to a fully localized CLI core.

---

## [v0.2.3] - 2025-10-14

### Added

- **Multilanguage support (i18n)**:
    - Added `i18n` module with `load_language()` and `tr()` functions.
    - Introduced translation files under `src/i18n/locales/` (`en.json`, `it.json`).
    - Added `src/i18n/locales/README.md` with key naming conventions.
    - CLI option `--lang` (or `-l`) allows overriding the language from configuration.
    - Config file can define a `language:` field for persistent preference.
    - Added `tr_with()` utility for runtime placeholder substitution (e.g., `{path}`, `{title}`).
- **Fallback system**: if a translation key is missing or the language file is unavailable, English (`en.json`) is used
  automatically.
- **Python helper script** (`scripts/extract_translations.py`):
    - Scans Rust source files for user-facing strings.
    - Updates `en.json` with any missing entries without overwriting existing ones.

### Changed

- All user-facing messages (`print_info`, `print_ok`, `print_err`, `println!`, etc.) are now translatable.
- Main startup sequence (`main.rs`) loads the selected language before configuration and database initialization.

### Improved

- Added helper in `config.rs` to read language preference directly from `librius.conf`.
- Enhanced verbosity filtering to respect localized messages.
- Clearer structure for future locale additions (fr, es, de, ...).

---

## [v0.2.2] - 2025-10-14

### Added

- **Structured database migration system**
    - Introduced `MigrationResult` enum replacing the previous boolean return value.
    - `run_migrations()` now returns explicit results (`Applied([...])` or `None`).
    - Each applied patch is now logged in the database with detailed information.
- **Patch safety improvements**
    - `PATCH_002` now checks for the existence of columns (`language`, `pages`, `genre`, `summary`) before adding them.
    - Prevents duplicate column errors on repeated runs.
- **Enhanced migration logging**
    - Migrations now record results under `DB_MIGRATION_OK`, `DB_MIGRATION_FAIL`, and `MIGRATIONS_COMPLETED` events in
      the `log` table.
    - Clear distinction between actual migrations and up-to-date states.

### Changed

- Refactored `run_migrations()` logic for clarity and maintainability.
- Updated database initialization flow (`start_db()`) to react dynamically to migration results.
- Improved internal output messages for migrations and startup consistency.

### Fixed

- Ensured safe re-execution of migration patches on existing databases.
- Removed redundant success messages when no migrations were needed.
- Unified patch logging behavior across all modules.

---

## [v0.2.1] - 2025-10-13

### Added

- **Database migrations**: introduced `db/migrate.rs` with incremental patch system and automatic execution at startup.
- **Configuration migrations**: added `config/migrate.rs` to automatically upgrade YAML configuration files.
- **Logging system**: new `utils::write_log()` function records database and migration events into the `log` table.
- **Verbose mode**: added global `--verbose` flag for diagnostic and debug output.
    - Normal mode: silent operation, only command results shown.
    - Verbose mode: shows configuration loading, database opening, and migration messages.
- **`db::start_db()`**: unified entry point that handles opening, creating, and migrating the database automatically.
- **Timestamp utility**: new `utils::now_str()` returns ISO 8601 formatted timestamps (`%+`).

### Changed

- Initialization messages are now hidden in normal mode.
- `main.rs` simplified: initialization logic moved into `db::start_db()`.
- `print_info()` and `print_ok()` now depend on verbose mode.

### Fixed

- Prevented redundant database initialization messages on repeated launches.
- Ensured migrations and configuration updates are idempotent and silent if up-to-date.
